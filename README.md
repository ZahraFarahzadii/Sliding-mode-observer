# Sliding-mode-observer
Sliding mode observer for fault reconstruction of time-delay and sampled-output systems.
a Time Shift Approach

Examples of data reconstruction:  
zero-order hold (ZOH)  
first-order hold (FOH)  
Interpolation first-order hold (IFOH)  
Interpolation second-order Hold (ISOH)  

there are 3 folders
